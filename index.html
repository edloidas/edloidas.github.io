            <p>
              The area of my expertise and interest consists of front end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript
              (as well as libraries and frameworks like Three.js, React, jQuery). io.js/Node.js are forming my server side skills.
              Also, as a supporter of open source, I'm trying to contribute and create such projects.

              It's hard not to play in the text editor, learning something new. But my area of interest is not that limited.
              I love music in all its forms, regardless of genre, as proud member of several guitars, among which there is a Gibson Les Paul 70's Tribute.
              I'm partial to the painting, architecture, calligraphy, as well as to the design (industrial and web design).
              It would be awesome to participate in a serious project for space industry in future.

                <p>
                  After a few days of interviews and test tasks, I joined the <a href="https://www.enonic.com/">Enonic</a> team.
                  The main project was <a href="https://github.com/enonic/xp">Enonic&nbsp;XP</a> (previously known as Enonic CMS).
                  It is an open-source project. We were trying to use the edge technologies with the latest features available.
                  The font end is written in TypeScript using some libraries (jQuery, SlickGrid), and back end
                  is written in Java using Elasticsearch and other. Sometimes, it was necessary to write some java code or
                  unit test, but the most of the time I was working with front end. One of my largest contributions to the project
                  were responsive manager, visual trees, collapsible list, client-server event manager
                  and some small performance improvements here and there in addition.

                <p>
                  I have spent almost month as a freelancer. It was a month of new discoveries. I've tried the AngularJS and Backbone.
                  They were awesome, but only on the first look. Three.js was the hit of a season and the WebGL became the common thing on the web.
                  I believe, that the VR will be the new thing there soon.

                <p>
                  After almost a year of experience with java in a large project, I became the (middle) java developer. Nothing much changed though.
                  Few more month and I decided to part my ways with the company. There were the good times, the bad times. I have gained the priceless experience.
                  I have realized, that the JavaScript is my passion, and I don't want to be java programmer anymore. Realized, that the Git is way better and more
                  powerful than the Rational ClearCase.

                  After attending the summer java courses at the <a href="http://sam-solutions.by/">SaM&nbsp;Solutions</a>,
                  I got a position at that company as junior java developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My first project was for the internal company needs: it was a Spring web application, a part of the
                  inner department portal, running under the GlassFish Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My second project was another web application with a build-in Tomcat. The purpose was to create a tool
                  to display (as table, collapsible tree and graph) and edit XML logs and settings. This project really improved
                  my skills in XML/XSLT/XPath.

                <p>
                  After a month, I became a part of the small team, that was working with the Fujitsu Siemens corporation
                  on a large project called Server View Suite. The part, that our team was responsible for, was the GUI
                  for managing the blade servers. I was working with the SSL, writting the unit tests, etc. We were using the
                  Rational CelarCase in the Server View Suite development and Subversion for the inner projects.
