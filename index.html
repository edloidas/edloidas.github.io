                  Norse know to to use edge technologies in production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a few days of interviews and test tasks, I joined the <a href="https://www.enonic.com/">Enonic</a> team.
                  The main project was <a href="https://github.com/enonic/xp">Enonic&nbsp;XP</a> (previously known as Enonic CMS).
                  It is an open-source project. We were trying to use the edge technologies with the latest features available.
                  The font end is written in <i>TypeScript</i> using some libraries (<i>jQuery</i>, <i>SlickGrid</i>), and back end
                  is written in <i>Java</i> using Elasticsearch and other. Sometimes, it was necessary to write some java code or
                  unit test, but the most of the time I was working with front end. One of my largest contributions to the project
                  were <i>responsive manager</i>, <i>visual trees</i>, <i>collapsible list</i>, <i>client-server event manager</i>
                  and some small performance improvements here and there in addition.

                <p>
                  Became a part of the <a href="https://www.scnsoft.com/ru">Science&nbsp;Soft</a> company as the <i>JavaScript</i> developer.
                  First and only project was a prototype of the new NYC taxi system, based on the <i>Node.js</i>. We didn't manage to win that tender.
                  After that, I signed a contract with another company, still being a employee of <i>Science&nbsp;Soft</i>.

                  <i>AngularJS</i> rocks? Not really. <i>WebGL</i> is the future and <i>Three.js</i> it's harbinger.

                <p>
                  I have spent almost month as a freelancer. It was a month of new discoveries. I've tried the <i>AngularJS</i> and <i>Backbone</i>.
                  They were awesome, but only on the first look. <i>Three.js</i> was the hit of a season and the <i>WebGL</i> became the common thing on the web.
                  I believe, that the <i>VR</i> will be the new thing there soon.

                  <i>ClearCase</i> is a headache. <i>Git</i> is my friend and <i>JavaScript</i> is my passion.

                <p>
                  After almost a year of experience with java in a large project, I became the <i>(middle) java developer</i>. Nothing much changed though.
                  Few more month and I decided to part my ways with the company. There were the good times, the bad times. I have gained the priceless experience.
                  I have realized, that the <i>JavaScript</i> is my passion, and I don't want to be java programmer anymore. Realized, that the <i>Git</i> is way better and more
                  powerful than the <i>Rational ClearCase</i>.

                <p class="tldr">
                  Started as a java developer. Improved my knowledge of the <i>Spring</i>, <i>HTML/CSS</i>, <i>jQuery</i>,
                  <i>XML/XSLT/XPath</i>, <i>Git</i>.
                  Get acquainted with <i>Rational ClearCase</i> and <i>SSL</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After attending the summer java courses at the <a href="http://sam-solutions.by/">SaM&nbsp;Solutions</a>,
                  I got a position at that company as <i>junior java developer</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My first project was for the internal company needs: it was a <i>Spring</i> web application, a part of the
                  inner department portal, running under the <i>GlassFish Server</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My second project was another web application with a build-in <i>Tomcat</i>. The purpose was to create a tool
                  to display (as table, collapsible tree and graph) and edit XML logs and settings. This project really improved
                  my skills in <i>XML/XSLT/XPath</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a month, I became a part of the small team, that was working with the <i>Fujitsu Siemens</i> corporation
                  on a large project called <i>Server View Suite</i>. The part, that our team was responsible for, was the GUI
                  for managing the blade servers. I was working with the SSL, writting the unit tests, etc. We were using the
                  Rational CelarCase in the <i>Server View Suite</i> development and <i>Subversion</i> for the inner projects.
