                  <i>AngularJS</i> rocks? Not really. <i>WebGL</i> is the future and <i>Three.js</i> it's harbinger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have spent almost month as a freelancer. It was a month of new discoveries. I've tried the <i>AngularJS</i> and <i>Backbone</i>.
                  They were awesome, but only on the first look. <i>Three.js</i> was the hit of a season and the <i>WebGL</i> became the common thing on the web.
                  I believe, that the <i>VR</i> will be the new thing there soon.

                  <i>ClearCase</i> is a headache. <i>Git</i> is my friend and <i>JavaScript</i> is my passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After almost a year of experience with java in a large project, I became the <i>(middle) java developer</i>. Nothing much changed though.
                  Few more month and I decided to part my ways with the company. There were the good times, the bad times. I have gained the priceless experience.
                  I have realized, that the <i>JavaScript</i> is my passion, and I don't want to be java programmer anymore. Realized, that the <i>Git</i> is way better and more
                  powerful than the Rational <i>ClearCase</i>.

                <time>2012-10-01</time>
                <p class="tldr">
                  Started as a java developer. Improved my knowledge of the <i>Spring</i>, <i>HTML/CSS</i>, <i>jQuery</i>,
                  <i>XML/XSLT/XPath</i>, <i>Git</i>.
                  Get acquainted with <i>Rational ClearCase</i> and <i>SSL</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After attending the summer java courses at the <a href="http://sam-solutions.by/">SaM&nbsp;Solutions</a>,
                  I got a position at that company as <i>junior java developer</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My first project was for the internal company needs: it was a <i>Spring</i> web application, a part of the
                  inner department portal, running under the <i>GlassFish Server</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My second project was another web application with a build-in <i>Tomcat</i>. The purpose was to create a tool
                  to display (as table, collapsible tree and graph) and edit XML logs and settings. This project really improved
                  my skills in <i>XML/XSLT/XPath</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a month, I became a part of the small team, that was working with the <i>Fujitsu Siemens</i> corporation
                  on a large project called <i>Server View Suite</i>. The part, that our team was responsible for, was the GUI
                  for managing the blade servers. I was working with the SSL, writting the unit tests, etc. We were using the
                  Rational CelarCase in the <i>Server View Suite</i> development and <i>Subversion</i> for the inner projects.
